# Ingham Medical Physics Coding Challenge

This repository is the submission for the Ingham Medical Pysical Coding Challenge.

**Task**
Using the data from HN_Radiomics.csv and HN_ClinicalData.csv to predict an outcome for a patient. In this repository, **overall_survival_in_days** and **recurrence_metastatic_free_survival_in_days** are selected as the outcomes respectively. Other features in HN_ClinicalData.csv and GTV in HN_Radiomics.csv are merged as the input of the model. Regression models and classification predictions are both proposed in the repository.

**Classification Model**
